Description: Tools for the analysis of business strategies for battery energy
    storage solutions.  The package enables a financial study of the
    utilisation of battery technologies in an arbitrage market and UK balancing
    mechanism markets to be performed.  It includes an optimisation
    algorithm for maximising financial return from an arbitrage market,
    definitions of the contractual rules for balancing market participation,
    forecasting of UK electricity spot prices and a model of the technical
    aspects of hardware e.g. charge rates, efficiency, degradation, etc.
